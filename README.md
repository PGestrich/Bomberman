# :bomb: Reinforcement Learning for Bomberman
This project is conducted as the final project of "Fundamentals of Machine Learning" in the winter semester 2021/2022.

## :pushpin: About the project
The aim of our project is to develop agents that can play the game Bomberman using the methods of machine learning.

## :page_with_curl: Prerequisites
In addition to the libraries you need to run the game and let rule-based agents play,
- for our Q-learning models, you need to install **sklearn** (version 1.0.2 is verified to work).
- for Deep, you need to install **tensorflow** (version 2.4.1 is verified to work).

## :octocat: Agents

### KillerKitty
Our Q-learning model for the tournament, which is capable of fighting against other agents.

### GreedyKitty
Our Q-learning model, which specifically aim at collecting as many coins as possible.

### Survival
Our prototype model whose goal is to survive in the game. Our kittens are built on the basis of this model.

### Deep
Our deep learning model.
